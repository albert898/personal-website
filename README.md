# Personal Website

This repository is to officially contain my code for my Personal Website. I have plans to take my capstone experience at Seattle University to create my own personal website.

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to practice Full Stack SWE skills. On top of that, I wanted to create my own personal website for personal growth and to add to my coding portfolio.

## To Do
- Create Mockups
- Define what will be on my website
- Purchase domain name
- Learn HTML & CSS

## Working on

I will be working on running my Web Application locally first. 

I plan to follow an HTML and CSS tutorial to gain a better understanding of these langauages. 

I plan to have my website be a static web application first before I make it dynamic.
